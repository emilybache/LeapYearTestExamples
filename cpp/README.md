# Leap Year Examples in C++

Look at the code under the tests folder to find examples of different styles of testing for a leap year function defined in code/leap.h

## Dependencies

The tests use the following header-only projects, which are in the `lib` sub-directory:

| Project | Licence |
| --- | --- |
| [catch2 test framework](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) | [Boost](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) |
| [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp) | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp/blob/master/LICENSE) |

## Acknowledgements

This code is based on the starter project at https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp.StarterProject

Use the original starter project if you are new to approval testing and/or if you have no instructor helping you. This project
removes some of the documentation and examples in order to make everything a little simpler.
