# Sample Project

This code is based on the starter project at https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp.StarterProject

Use the original if you are new to approval testing and/or if you have no instructor helping you. This project
removes some of the documentation and examples in order to make everything a little simpler.

## Dependencies

The tests use the following header-only projects, which are in the `lib` sub-directory:
